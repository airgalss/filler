### 2024.1.10

* Cleaned up the src directory and moved help files and utility files to the 
project root directory.
* Streamlined directory structure by merging all configuration files into the 
conf directory and placing input PDFs and output PDFs at the same level under 
the data directory.

### 2024.1.21

* Optimized code and adjusted directory structure for better encapsulation.
* Implemented a decorator-based hook for converting external dictionaries into 
dictionaries that conform to the field.json key names.

### 2024.2.25

* Enhanced the tools/ script for improved automation.

### 2024.3.1
* Improved robustness of the PDF templates by using field_name instead of xref 
positioning in the configuration files. This allows the code and configuration 
files to continue functioning correctly even if the xref values are modified by 
a PDF editor during PDF modification, without requiring any modifications to 
the code or configuration files.
